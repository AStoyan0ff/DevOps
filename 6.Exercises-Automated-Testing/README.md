### Environment and Compatibility Improvements

| Original issue | Implemented solution |
|---|---|
| Projects targeted the unsupported `.NET 6` framework | Migrated all related projects to `.NET 8` |
| ChromeDriver 125/126 was incompatible with the installed browser | Removed the pinned driver and enabled automatic management through Selenium Manager |
| The hosted Number Calculator was unavailable | Added a compatible local test fixture preserving the original selectors and behavior |
| Strict Postman property assertion failed on additional API fields | Replaced `all.keys()` with `include.all.keys()` |
| Selenium IDE was unavailable in Chromium extension stores | Used the supported Firefox extension and the exported C# project |
| Generated dependencies and test artifacts polluted the repository | Added an appropriate `.gitignore` configuration |
